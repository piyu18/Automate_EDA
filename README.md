# Automate Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis is a data exploration technique to understand the various aspects of the data.
It is used to find patterns, missing values, outliers, visual insight etc, before proceeding for Model training.
Instead of spending lot of time doing EDA to get better understanding of data, we can use auto visualization tools such as Pandas Profiling,
D-Tale, Sweetviz etc.
